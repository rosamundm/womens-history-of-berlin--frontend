I designed this website as an English-language portal for anyone who's ever wondered about the women behind Berlin street names such as Rosa-Luxemburg-Stra√üe... and many, many more!

This project was built with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). Using Netlify's [serverless functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/), I proxied requests to an external API that I built myself. The site is also hosted on Netlify.
