                        There's a famous Berlin street named after a princess that I can't find on 
                        here, for some reason. Why?

                        Since there are so many such streets (among them LuisenstraÃŸe, SophienstraÃŸe, and a 
                        surprising number of instances of Kaiserin-Augusta-StraÃŸe), I have decided not to prioritise 
                        them here. Here is why:

                        In general, I prefer not to glorify nobility and instead would like to focus my efforts on figures 
                        who earned their recognition. I especially aim to honour those who were persecuted or killed for some 
                        aspect of their beliefs or identity.

                        Furthermore, most of these empresses and suchlike were part of the Hohenzollern dynasty, which was responsible 
                        for colonial crimes that Germany still does not adequately acknowledge, like the <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/herero-and-nama-dispute-genocide-agreement-with-germany/a-64476907">genocide of the Herero and the Namaqua</a>.

                        For the people I do profile, hopefully it goes without saying that I don't necessarily agree with every single thing they stood for.

                        That's true, many of the people featured here were born in places like Prussia. I decided early on in the project to refer 
                        to cities as they are in the present day. For instance, what was then <i>Schwiebus, Prussia</i> will be called <i>Åšwiebodzin, Poland</i> here â€” 
                        the modern country and endonym.

                        The exception is using the widespread English name where it's available, e.g. <i>Vienna</i> and not <i>Wien</i>. My project is in English 
                        and so I don't want to overcomplicate things by having to make decisions like whether I would call it <i>Schwiebus, PreuÃŸen</i> (sticking 
                        to all German and thus presupposing an imperial German lens on the place, as well as the reader's knowledge of the German names) or <i>Schwiebus, Prussia</i> (German/English mix, illogical and pointless for my audience).

                        Take as an example the fact that many Ukrainians are asking the world to refer to their capital city as <i>Kyiv</i> (Ukrainian transliteration) 
                        and not <i>Kiev</i> (Russian transliteration) outside of those respective languages. Although both languages are widely spoken in Ukraine, they want 
                        the official language â€” the one that's unique to their culture, which in turn has centuries of ongoing history of being repressed by the other 
                        culture â€” to take precedent.

                        The concept of a nation can be a complex one, but if you're that interested in the history of a place where a certain figure died or was 
                        born, the internet is your oyster.
